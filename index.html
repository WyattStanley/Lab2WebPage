            <h1>What is Human Ecology?</h1>
        
            <p>
                Human ecology is an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary study of the relationship 
                between humans and their natural, social, and built environments.

            <h1>How Human Ecology is Understood Today</h1>
            <p>
                Today there is greater emphasis on the problems facing individuals and how actors deal with them with the 
                consequence that there is much more attention to decision-making at the individual level as people strategize 
                and optimize risk, costs and benefits within specific contexts. Rather than attempting to formulate a cultural 
                ecology or even a specifically "human ecology" model, researchers more often draw on demographic, economic and 
                evolutionary theory as well as upon models derived from field ecology.

            <h1>Ecosystem Services</h1>
            <p>
                The ecosystems of planet Earth are coupled to human environments. Ecosystems regulate the global geophysical 
                cycles of energy, climate, soil nutrients, and water that in turn support and grow natural capital (including 
                the environmental, physiological, cognitive, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of life). Ultimately, every 
                manufactured product in human environments comes from natural systems.
